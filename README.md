# 4300Project
Grade Application that allows students and teachers to track their current and desired grade

Team Project Members: Anokhi Patel, Dasnee Bailey, Mary Brown

For our project, we decided to create the grade calculator. After looking at our feedback for the project description, in our brainstorm, we decide that we were going to enable a teacher to enroll for a specific class, so they are able to access their students’ grades. Multiple students can add in their grades, along with its weight, and their desired grade in the class, which will be saved for that specific class. For example, a student would select their class name, and then add in their current grades for their assignments and tests along with its weight. After that, they have an option to enter a number from 0-100 as their desired grade. Once they save their inputs, the average will be displayed along with what grade they should make on the rest of their assignments in order to make the desired grade by the end of the semester. Once a class is created, another student will have the ability to select the same class or add a new one as well. A teacher can access the students’ grades by “enrolling” as a teacher for the class.

As for our coding, we have begun to do the basic HTML and CSS coding in order to display the web page. Along with that, we have created functions for the user to input their grades and print out the average for the class. Eventually, we will continue on with our project, we may or may not make certain changes for it if we have better ideas on how to create the grade calculator.
